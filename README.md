# Vibe-Based Restaurant Recommendations with Community Engagement

FoodVybe is an intelligent restaurant recommendation platform that aligns food suggestions with user mood and context, recognising that food cravings often reflect individual vibes.
Just like the music we listen to depends on our mood, the food we crave also reflects our vibe. FoodVybe is an intelligent restaurant recommendation platform that helps users discover meals matching their current mood, preferences, and context:

- Personalised Recommendations: Suggests meals tailored to mood, local weather conditions, location, and historical behaviour. 

- Community Engagement: Supports communities of users with similar dietary habits or food interests, allowing the sharing of reviews, curated lists, and peer verified recommendations.

- Feedback Driven AI: Community interactions feed back into the recommendation engine, improving relevance, reducing decision fatigue, and enhancing engagement and retention.

If a user is unwell, FoodVybe shifts to comfort mode, suggesting gentle and healing meals such as vegetable broth, lemon tea, or light soups.

When the monsoon hits, FoodVybe’s got it covered — recommending cosy favourites like pakode, chai, and Maggi to match the weather and vibe.

It’s not just about recommendations though,  it’s also about connection. Users can join communities of people with similar dietary habits, whether they’re following a Keto plan, living the Vegan life, or simply exploring new cuisines. These communities help each other stay motivated, share hidden gems, and swap restaurant finds. From cosy comfort cravings to discovering the next favourite spot together, the experience is all about food, mood, and good vibes.

Here’s an example of a user sharing a vegan burger they recently tried in a community post.

Our community plays a key role in making the platform smarter every day. Users help enhance recommendations by tagging dishes with the moods they align with — whether it’s comfort food for a rainy day or a refreshing bowl for a sunny afternoon. They also share newly discovered restaurants catering to specific diets like vegan, keto, or gluten free, helping others find their next perfect meal. Every tag, share, and review makes the system more intuitive, personalised, and mood aware.

Every meal tells a story — and now, it can set the mood too! Users can tag the dishes they order with the mood it fits best : comforting, Celebratory, Lazy Day Meal, or even under the weather. These tags help refine future recommendations, making them more intuitive and personalised. So the next time someone’s craving something “chill” or “cheerful,” your tagged dishes might just inspire their choice!

The platform has had a bunch of exciting updates, but there’s still some backend magic to work on. Some images were flagged as duplicates, and a few others require correction. Further refinements and improvements are planned to enhance the platform.
