# Vibe-Based Restaurant Recommendations with Community Engagement

FoodVybe is an intelligent restaurant recommendation platform that aligns food suggestions with user mood and context, recognising that food cravings often reflect individual vibes.
Just like the music we listen to depends on our mood, the food we crave also reflects our vibe. FoodVybe is an intelligent restaurant recommendation platform that helps users discover meals matching their current mood, preferences, and context:

- Personalised Recommendations: Suggests meals tailored to mood, local weather conditions, location, and historical behaviour. For example, on a rainy day in Gandhinagar, pakode, chai, or Maggi might be recommended to match typical cravings.

- Community Engagement: Supports communities of users with similar dietary habits or food interests, allowing the sharing of reviews, curated lists, and peer-verified recommendations.

- Feedback-Driven AI: Community interactions feed back into the recommendation engine, improving relevance, reducing decision fatigue, and enhancing engagement and retention.
